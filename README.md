# PSU Dynamic Shortest Path

This project implement dynamic shortest path algorithms for transportation networks with time-dependent travel times. Its capable to define travel time functions for network links, verify FIFO principle compliance, compute shortest paths for different departure times, and analyze travel time equality between paths

## Usage
Run the script: `python DynamicShortest_Path.py`

## Academic Purposes
This code is designed for educational purposes. Serves as a starting point for more complex models and could be adapted for real-time routing in navigation apps, but it is not intended for production use. It prioritizes clarity over performance, making it suitable for learning and experimentation. Penn State University (PSU), CE 521 Transportation Network and Systems Analysis. Fall 2025.
